--find a path in a weighted graph
--	uses A* algorithm internally
--returns a table of all the nodes from the start to the goal,
--	or false if no path was found
--arguments table requires the following fields
--	start - the value of the node to start from
--		alias: start_node
--	is_goal - a function which takes a node, and returns true is a goal
--		alias: goal
--	neighbours - a function which takes a node, and returns a table of neighbour nodes
--		alias: generate_neighbours
--	distance - a function which given two nodes, returns the distance between them
--		defaults to a constant distance, which means all steps between nodes have the same cost
--		alias: weight, g
--	heuristic - a function which given a node, returns a heuristic indicative of the distance to the goal;
--		can be used to speed up searches at the cost of accuracy by returning some proportion higher than the actual distance
--		defaults to a constant value, which means the A* algorithm degrades to breadth-first search
--		alias: h
